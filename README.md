-We at Shiburai believe in the power of a strong community. We prove our loyalty to our community through our unique governance system that gives a voice to every token holder. Together, we the people make key decisions on the direction of our project! Shiburai is truly a project for the people by the people. Unlike many projects, we donâ€™t simply burn tokens or hold them in a passive wallet, our revolutionary new transcendence burn, which will surely inspire many copycats, will bring real value to our holders! We use taxes from our buys and sells for our unique fund which is spent in several ways to generate passive gains for Shiburai holders. Our interactive dashboard will allow users to track their progress live and withdraw their earnings from our faucet.


Founded on Community

We at Shiburai believe in the power of a strong community. We pledge our loyalty to our community through our
unique governance system that gives a voice to every token holder. Together, we the people make key decisions on
the direction of our project! Shiburai is truly a project for the people by the people. Currently voting will be held on
the Shiburai Snapshot page here:
We've combined innovative new token mechanics such as our deflationary model that doesn't simply discard tokens
into passive wallets but transcends other deflation strategies (explained below). We utilize fees from our token's
transactions as a source for returning passive gains to Shiburai holders through a strategy called Dynamic Access
Fund. Our interactive dashboard will allow users to track their progress live and withdraw their earnings from the
Spring of Life. Exclusive generate NFT collections will be available to mint only for Shiburai holders which allow
them to become share holders in various platform fees as well as revenue generated from the DAF. The Way of the
Shiburai is to do good to all, grow stronger together, and to find prosperity, peace, and enjoyment in DEFI.
